# Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning? 
A field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 

Machine learning is a class of algorithms which are data-driven. 

Provide a training set and the machine learning algorithm will learn from the training set. 

## Types of Machine Learning
* Supervised learning (labeled data)
* Unsupervised learning (unlabeled data)


## Supervised Learning
Predict an outcome based on input data. Machine learning model will learn the relationship between the features and the response. Make predictions on _new data_. Continuous: regression. Categorical: clustering. 

## Unsupervised Learning
Extract structure from unlabled data. The goal is to represent the data based on some characteritics or properties. Continuous: dimension, reduction. Categorical: clustering. 


## Machine Learning Terminology
* __Observstion__ known as samples, records of data
* __Feature__ predictors, independent variables
* __Response__ known as outcome
* __Regression problems__ have continuous response. 
* __Classification problems__ have categoricla response.



## Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors
Classify the unidentifed data based on its closest neigbors's features. 

Ex. Predictiing the color of a dot based on color of dots closest to the uncolored dot.

Advantages: Model training phase is fast. Simple to understand. 

Disadvantages: Prediction phase can be slow if _n_ is large. Sensitive to irrelevant features.
